# labpistec-ideas
Ideas, meeting minutes and discussion between GEOTEC and LABPSITEC research groups

## Motivation
We (GEOTEC) want to start a prolonged colaboration with the LABPSITEC grouo to reach a win-win situation. On one hand, we seek our geospatial developments and toods make a real, social impact in the sense they might be used in real experiments, on the streets. On the other, LABPSITEC group can benefit from technology and tools ready to be used in technology-driven interventions and experiments with cohorts of patients and hence considerably shorthenen tiems for data collection, analysis adn decision making.

## Minutes

### Meeting 2017-12-12
Participants. LABPSITEC (Juani), GEOTEC (Nacho, Luis, Ditsuhi, Carlos, Sven)

Improvements of visualisation tool developed by Ditsuhi:
* a more advanced tool is available
* demonstration was given
TO DO:
* deploy the tool publicly, so everybody can access it (GEOTEC)
* updates to the tool (GEOTEC)
* check the tools, specifically usability, type of data & graphs used (LABPSITEC)
* tell us improvements (suggest additional data visualisations; change of graph type; other grouping of data; etc.)  (LABPSITEC)

Data collection app:
- a more advanced version is available, with the following new features:

TO DO:
* solve remaining issues/bugs (GEOTEC)
* use the application and report issues/bugs (LABPSITEC)
* look at the interaction flow at setup (therapist enters data; user captures home location) & provide feedback (LABPSITEC)


Experiment:
* Ditsihu needs to submit her master thesis 1 February & needs some type of validation
* different possibilities for experiments (validation) were discussed: 
  * therapist use the tool and perform a questionnaire aimed at showing improved ability to understand data, improved time of interpreting the data, better insight in data, ability to better tailor therapy, etc. (LABPSITEC input appreciated)
  * use of the tool with real patients, if possible. (Different options: 1 group of patients, all using both the tool and previous paper-based approach; 2 groups of patients, 1 new tool & 1 paper based). Similar analysis can be done as in previous point (questionnaire), but additional analyses are possible (e.g., compare paper-based collection with tool-based collection) (LABPSITEC input appreciated)
* exact experiment (to serve as validation for thesis Ditsuhi) not decided (LABPSITEC input appreciated)
* later (after 20 January), additional experiments are possible
TO DO:
* define a realistic (regarding time) experiment that can be performed (finished) by January 20. (LABPSITEC & GEOTEC)
